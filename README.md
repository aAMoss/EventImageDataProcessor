# Event Image Data Processor


The purpose of this program is to pre-process the N-MNIST dataset (an event-image dataset, AER) for classification with a
Multiclass Tsetlin Machine.

The program is still a work in progress, and was created for my 3rd year university project.

Please be nice, this is my first attempt at coding a larger program.

There's a lot to improve and debug, I make no guarantees for the program compiling or working on your system.

The Makefile specifies gcc, although I have been compiling and test the program so far via the MacOS Terminal, 
I believe it actually uses the Apple Verion of CLang, so your experience may vary.

Will be posting some more indepth instructions on how to sue the program soon.
