# Event Image Data Processor

## Overview 

The purpose of this program is to pre-process the N-MNIST dataset (an event-image dataset, AER) for classification with a
Multiclass Tsetlin Machine.

The program is still a work in progress, and was created for my 3rd year university project.

Please be nice, this is my first attempt at coding a larger program.

There's a lot to improve and debug, I make no guarantees for the program compiling or working on your system.

## Instructions

Clone the respository.

Ensure that you have a copy of the N-MNIST dataset in the top-level directory. 

The dataset and its accompanying paper are available [here](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist) and [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00437/full).


Ensure the dataset is located here: EventImageDataProcessor/N-MNIST/

Ensure that its sub-directories are labelled: Test and Train.
