// hyper.c - Hyper-parameters and configuration

// just experimenting right now

// HYPER PARAMETERS

// Packet Size in number of events - could this be made the percentage of the event sample??
// Packet Overlap in number of events - could this be a percentage as well?
// Maybe have a configuration parameter that is set before running make that determines if these values are fixed or percentages

// number of features - feature extraction method dependent
